    "In this study I show that customer paths can be predicted in a federated setup. \n",

    "Federated learning [[1](#mcmahan2016communication)] is a term used for distributed computation setups, where \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is important\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning allows both high level of data protection and personalization.\n",
    "For the public sector, this opens up a way to provide novel digital services. \n",
    "For example cities or governments can create personal AI assistants that give citizens personalized recommendation for variety of topics,\n",
    "including preventative healthcare and career advice.\n",
    "These kind of services require very sensitive data, that the citizens may be unwilling to trust the government with.\n",
    "Federated learning can help provide the same services, without the need for data share.\n",
    "In addition, with contrast to centralized modelling, the models are fitted on each customers own data\n",
    "\n",
    "The results can also be applied to other next state prediction problems not involving human customers,\n",
    "but artificial clients insted. One such example could be predicting faults on IoT devices.\n",
